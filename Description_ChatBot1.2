There are quiet a few things that I have improved, the first one is that since the chatterbot tends to be very repetitive, I have devised a mechanism to control these repetitions. I could simply store the previous response of that Chatbot within a string sPrevResponse and make some checkings when selecting the next bot response to see if it's not equal to the previous response. If it is the case, I can select a new response from the available responses.

The other thing that I have improved is the way that the chatbot handles the users inputs, currently if I enter an input then it is in lower case the Chatbot would not understand anything about it even if there would be a match inside the bot's database for that input. Also if the input contains extra spaces or punctuation characters (!;,.) this also would prevent the Chatbot from understanding the input. That's I have tried to introduce some new mechanism to preprocess the userâ€™s inputs before it can be search into the Chatbot database. I have used a function to put the users inputs in upper case since the keywords inside the database are in uppercase and another procedure to just remove all of the punctuations and extra spaces that could be found within users input.
